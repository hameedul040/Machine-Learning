1.Restructure.m-> restructures the dataset into groups of characters
Bad data is removed after careful analysis

2.GenerateFeatures.py->Generates the features that will be used for analysis and development of ML models

3.select_model.py-> a comparitive analysis of various classifiers is done for selecting best model

4.KNN_module->Implements KNN and performs grid search .

5.ExtraTreeStats-> Extra tree classifier is implemented and generates stats of accuracy vs number of trees

6. Extratree classifier results-> contains results and data from which extra trees.png is generated.

Initially Matlab was chosen for implementing the project, but seeing the industry affinity towards Python,
